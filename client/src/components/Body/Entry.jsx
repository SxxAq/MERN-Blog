            Today, instead of comparing Turo’s pace of revenue growth in Q1 2023
            to the same period a year earlier, we’re going to compare that with
            Turo’s revenue growth rate t so the growth that the company is
            seeing today could be argued to be more “organic” than what it saw a
            year ago.
